<h2>"Sailing The Seven Seas"(2007-2017)</h2>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
	<p><span>Big hello to you all</span>,
 I hope this web page brings you closer 
to a unique kind of work experience.
My name is Jasmina and I was a
cruise ship worker for 10 years. 
I was part of youth staff team
across the Carnival Cruise Line’s fleet. 
I’ve embarked my first ship in 2007th.
It was Carnival Glory, sailing
from Port Canaveral in Florida. 
Now I was a small-town girl from Croatia and never
was I anywhere outside of my country before. 
You can all imagine how I felt landing in Miami. 
It was a night flight and all I saw was endless city lights. 
Looked like a giant labyrinth from above. 
Feeling was intimidating, I will never forget it. 
I thought I’ll get lost for sure. My hometown has around 10.000 souls
and Miami about 6,200.00, so yea, it was scary 😊. 
Somehow I came to my hotel and had a night of rest. 
Next day was about to sign on to Glory.
One thing I will never forget is that all the way to the ship
I saw at least 6-7 rainbows, which I thought was a good sign😊. 
When I came in front of Glory, first thing I wanted to do was
to turn around and run back home. 
She was HUGE! (And yes, we refer to a ship as She, I was told it’s for good luck) 
Just thinking how I must spend 6 months or half of year on this “thing”, 
got me tremendously homesick. 
However, my family spent lot of money to get me there
so I knew I had to “suck it up” and endure one contract so
I can, at least, return the money invested in me. 
Little that I knew then that I will stay for so long, 
because it turned out I was sailor at heart😊. 
It change me, it developed me, it widened my horizons, it made me stronger, 
it thought me a lot about other countries and nationalities, 
it build up my work experience and gave me memories and world wide family
I will never forget. 
10 years passed so fast but I have to admit that this one is true 
“Ones a sailor always a sailor”.
I caught myself feeling nostalgic many times on land. 
Longing for my ship friends, work colleagues, 
guests and kids, I’ve met along, that sense of team who helps each other win on daily basis. 
My managers who were always there for all their team members thorugh "calm and rough seas", 
pushing them to grow more and motivating us to give our best but 
to also have bunch of fun in the process. 
As happy worker will be a successful one, we all believed.
Anyways, I’ll try to bring you closer to all the ports of call I’ve visited and, 
maybe interest you, to try  life on the ship for yourself. 
As a future employee or as a guest, both ways will be a ones in a life time adventure, 
I’m certain of it. 😊</p>
